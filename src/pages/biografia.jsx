      <div className='biografia_flex'>
   <p className='biografia_parrafo'>Greetings! I'm Belu Di Martino, and my life is an exciting blend of art and creativity. From my childhood, my heart has beaten to the rhythm of dance and circus.
<br></br>
My journey in the world of art began at the tender age of 8 when my mother took me to my first dance classes: classical, contemporary, and jazz. In that very moment, I knew I had found my true place in the world.
<br></br><br></br>
At the age of 15, I took the next step and delved into the world of art professionally. The theater in my city offered me the opportunity to study to become a dance teacher, an achievement that fills me with pride. As I advanced in my training as a dance teacher, I continued to hone my skills in the circus.
<br></br>
At 18, I earned my teaching degree and started sharing my knowledge as a dance teacher. My classes and workshops cover a wide range of styles, from Femme Style to Heels, Street Dance, Lyrical Jazz, and Contemporary Jazz. My passion for dance has allowed me to nurture generations of talented artists.
<br></br><br></br>
At 20, the opportunity to join a renowned circus in my country, with a long circus tradition, came knocking on my door. For a year and a half, we toured the entire country, bringing the magic of the circus to audiences of all ages. This experience deepened my connection to the circus world and allowed me to perfect my skills in aerial techniques.
<br></br>
Following my national tour, my circus career took me beyond the borders of my country. I had the good fortune to learn from acrobats from all over the world in international circuses in South America. This allowed me to create traditional circus acts while also exploring the contemporary circus.
<br></br>
Today, my repertoire includes a wide variety of acts, from Aerial Hoop, Pole Dance, Aerial Straps in duos and solos to performances on Chains, and much more. My versatility is my hallmark, both in the air and on the dance floor.
<br></br><br></br>
My most recent experience was at Vangart, where I directed an Aerial Straps duo under the guidance of Sean McKeown, who was previously the artistic director of Cirque du Soleil. This was a milestone in my career and motivated me to continue seeking new and exciting opportunities in the world of entertainment.
<br></br>
Today, I am a well-rounded dancer, capable of adapting to any style you may require. Dance and the circus are my life, and I'm excited about every challenge the future holds.
<br></br><br></br>
I hope you enjoy my art as much as I enjoy creating it!</p>
