      <div className='biografia_flex'>
   <p className='biografia_parrafo'>Greetings! I'm Belu Di Martino, and my life is an exciting blend of art and creativity. From my childhood, my heart has beaten to the rhythm of dance and circus.
<br></br>
My journey in the world of art began at the tender age of 8 when my mother took me to my first dance classes: classical, contemporary, and jazz. In that very moment, I knew I had found my true place in the world.
<br></br><br></br>
At 15, I delved into the world of art professionally, studying to become a dance teacher. I earned my teaching degree at 18 and started sharing my knowledge. My classes cover a wide range of styles, from Femme Style to Street Dance.
<br></br>
At 20, I joined a renowned circus, touring the country for a year and a half, deepening my connection to the circus world and perfecting my skills in aerial techniques.
<br></br><br></br>
My circus career then took me beyond my country's borders, learning from acrobats in international circuses in South America. Today, my repertoire includes Aerial Hoop, Pole Dance, Aerial Straps, Chains, and more.
<br></br>
I recently directed an Aerial Straps duo under the guidance of Sean McKeown, the former artistic director of Cirque du Soleil. This experience motivates me to seek new opportunities in entertainment.
<br></br>
I'm a well-rounded dancer, excited about every challenge the future holds. I hope you enjoy my art as much as I enjoy creating it!<br></br><br></br>
